KiCad windows packing scripts with NSIS
=======================================

This is a collection of stuff used for packing KiCad for windows by building in
the MSYS2 environment and then package the bits with the NSIS installer. This is
magic or something... I dunno, I am very bad at writing random stuff.

The current workflow is as follows:
1. Install MSYS2 and configure the environment (update and install git, and
   toolchains)
2. Clone the MINGW packages [3]
3. Go to the kicad package
4. Then do: makepkg-mingw -s (-s option installs depends)
5. Now configure the variables in the copydlls.sh script
6. Now RUN!
7. You now got a funky exe for the arch you specified.

The NSIS installer script has been tested with NSIS 3.0.b1. Also the nsis folder
is a fork of what was in the KiCad offical repo.

I consider this repo as a staging area.
